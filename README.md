# weather_app
The application uses openweathermap.org to get current weather.
At the current moment this project implements such technologies as Retrofit2, Gson parcing, RecyclerView, Room,  different layouts (LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout). The application is in process for new features and ideas. For suggestions and criticism please contact me

The APK file is already builded (weather.apk), all you need is just download it from repository.
